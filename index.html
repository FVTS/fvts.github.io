    <p>
      Christians have been celebrating Good Friday and Easter for
      nearly 2,000 years.  But why?  That Jesus of Nazareth was
      executed is a given, but what does the Easter holiday celebrate?
      Was Jesus really raised from the dead?  Was that even the message
      first Christians sought to spread?  Or did they know, even then,
      that this was a metaphorical tale?  How has the story been
      understood since those first days of the Christian movement?
      Join us as we consider how different traditions have historically
      understood the story of the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth.
      All are welcome!

    Nicholas is a resident of Batavia and a PhD candidate at Wheaton
    College. His dissertation addresses first century socio-rhetorical
    uses of sacred texts for the sake of community formation. This
    upcoming talk and discussion will revolve around only a slightly
    different topic. At the end of the 19th century Friedrich
    Nietzsche also used religious texts to give shape to the
    burgeoning postmodern world when he proclaimed that “God is
    dead.” Western thinkers in every discipline from political
    theory to the fine arts have taken up this “death of God” motif
    throughout the 20th century. Nicholas has observed, however,
    in his years of teaching philosophy to high school seniors and
    college freshmen, that what Nietzsche specifically meant has
    been lost in the intervening years. Perhaps it is time to
    reevaluate Nietzsche’s famous pronouncement in the light of
    more than a century’s worth of retrospect. Join us on February
    26th at 10am at the Batavia Public Library for a lecture and
    open discussion and Q&A as we consider what it means and whether
    it is true that “God is dead.”
