title: Do Some People Really Believe a Dead Man Came Back to Life?
#subtitle: How have different traditions understood the story of the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth?
description: |
    To believe that a dead man came back to life is a lot to swallow.
    No wonder there have been many theories as to what actually happened
    on the first “Easter” morning, and what kicked off the Christian
    movement.  Join us as we consider how different traditions have
    historically understood the story of the resurrection of Jesus of
    Nazareth.  There will be a 50 minute lecture followed by open
    Q&amp;A/discussion.  All are welcome.

bio: |
    Dr. Piotrowski is the Professor of Hermeneutics and New Testament
    at Crossroads Bible College.  He earned his PhD from Wheaton College
    in 2013, where he studied the way different communities employ
    ancient sacred texts to understand their identity in the world.
    His studies and teaching experience suite him well to explore the
    ancient story of Jesus’ resurrection and what it means in today’s
    world.
