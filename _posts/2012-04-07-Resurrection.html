title: Do Some People Really Believe a Dead Man Came Back to Life?
subtitle: How have different traditions understood the story of the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth?
description: Christians have been celebrating Good Friday and Easter for nearly 2,000 years.  But why?  That Jesus of Nazareth was executed is a given, but what does the Easter holiday celebrate?  Was Jesus really raised from the dead?  Was that even the message first Christians sought to spread?  Or did they know, even then, that this was a metaphorical tale?  How has the story been understood since those first days of the Christian movement?  Join us as we consider how different traditions have historically understood the story of the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. All are welcome!
